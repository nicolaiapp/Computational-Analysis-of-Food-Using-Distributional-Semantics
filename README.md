__abstract__


Often the evaluation of food text representations is still done by hand, in lack of good automated evaluation methodologies. Visualizations of distributional food semantics are often not used to their full potential. There are only a few works that use dense word embeddings and more complex food corpus model techniques in general, such as topic modeling.


This thesis gives an overview of the existing literature and helps define the rather new field of research of the computational analysis of food using distributional semantics.

The use of various food text representations is investigated, creating embeddings and successfully conducting new experimental benchmarks in order to evaluate them.


The methodology of these automated benchmarks is explained step-by-step, showcasing powerful Python libraries.

Latent topics in a food dataset are extensively explored, with various visualizations techniques for a more intuitive understanding.

It is shown that a smaller domain specific corpus can produce embeddings with similar and sometimes better food category prediction capabilities as embeddings based on very large corpora such as Wikipedia or Google News.

An interesting find is how beneficial subword-level embeddings are in the context of food and what the reasons for this are. Complicated embeddings that include food image and recipe instructions information did generally perform not better and sometimes much worse than a simpler baseline embedding based on the same corpus.

It is shown how visualizations can be used to very eff ectively to explain results and describe datasets in an intuitive way.

The presented detailed list of the available linguistic food resources helps others in rapidly applying the techniques mentioned in this thesis to other datasets.
